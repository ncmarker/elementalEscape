# Prototype

- Controls work with both keyboard and UI input.
- Can test/use each element player's power-up (hit Enter on keyboard).
- Animations work (they are delayed... need to fix & add sound).
- Can traverse the map without exceeding edges, and will die if you fall down.
- Dying returns you back to the levels page, and on the levels page, you can select a level _(only select Level 1 for now)_.

# Final Gameplay

- 4 class inclusions: UI elements (buttons etc.), collisions (potions, boxes, etc.), physics (player movement), animations (player, player actions, etc.), touch input (touch buttons to play)
- play the game starting on the 'start' scene 
- directions on how to play are included in the game levels screen
- can play any level (they are increasing difficulty)
- to quit a level click the 'X' in the top right 
- to hear sound effects increase volume 
- intended play is on horizontal phone, if on desktop adjust the screen ratio to be relatively close to a horizontal phone
