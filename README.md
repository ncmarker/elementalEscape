# Elemental Escape

**Elemental Escape** is a 2D single-player platformer designed for mobile but also playable on PC with a keyboard. Players navigate through 10 levels of increasing difficulty, using the elemental powers of fire, air, water, and earth to reach the silver door at the end of each stage. Each element introduces a unique mechanic—fire shoots fireballs, air provides a boosted jump, water enables teleportation through puddles, and earth raises platforms. Since potions that grant these powers can only be used once per level, players must think strategically about when and how to use them.
